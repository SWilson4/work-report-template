As we agreed, I have prepared the enclosed report, ``\reporttitle,'' for my \term{} work report and for the \team. This report, the \nth{} of four work reports that the Co-operative Education Program requires that I successfully complete as part of my \academicprogram{} Co-op degree requirements, has not received academic credit.

% Replace this lipsum with a brief description of your role in the company, and your duties at the company.

The Faculty of Mathematics requests that you evaluate this report for command of topic and technical content/analysis. Following your assessment, the report, together with your evaluation, will be submitted to the Math Undergrad Office for evaluation on campus by qualified work report markers. The combined marks determine whether the report will receive credit and whether it will be considered for an award.

Thank you for your assistance in preparing this report.
